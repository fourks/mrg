      <h1>MicroRaptor Gui</h1>
      
      <p>MicroRaptor Gui is a C API for creating user interfaces, it can be
      used as an app<span style='color:red'>lica</span>tion writing environment or as an interactive canvas
      for part of a larger interface.</p>

      <p>Micro raptor builds on/integrates with cairos immediate mode vector
      rendering API</p>
      
      <p>Callbacks registered during the painting of the frame - the cairo
      transformations in place during registration applies when called. Also
      works for dragging. Keybindings are also registered during painting.</p>

      <p>Embeddable and stand-alone - as a "canvas" mrg can be used as widgets
      in Gtk+ applications or full-blown applications.</p>

      <p>Multi-platform, both through SDL and GTKs multiplatform support, and
      built-in TUI (UTF-8 ansi/vt100) support for most modern terminals.<p>

      <p>CSS styled rendering (using a context stack; where the pushing of
      contexts specifies the "element.class#id" of each now element rendering
      entered.</p>


      <h3>Backends / dependencies</h3>

      <p>MicroRaptor Gui has three <span style="font-size:0.8em;">independent</span> backends it can use, SDL-1.2,
      GTK+-3.0 and ANSI/vt100 terminals, the GTK backend provides both full
      application hosting, and a widget for use as a canvas in
      GTK+applications. The terminal backends has mouse support, is utf8
      native and for simple text-centric applications you can even build
      static libraries skipping even the cairo support.</p>
      
      <h3>Immediate mode UIs</h3>
      <p>
      In terms of programming paradigm, microraptor contains aspects of 
      both traditional retained widget-tree/scene-graph ui's and 
      <a href="http://iki.fi/sol/imgui/">(purist) immediate mode uis</a>.
      Since microraptor doesn't have a retained scenegraph, and some of
      the freedoms gained with <em>imgui</em>, like being able to paint
      incrementally directly from data-structures are also gained
      with microraptor.
